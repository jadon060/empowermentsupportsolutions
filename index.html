    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Empowerment Support Solutions LLC (ESS) is dedicated to helping individuals in California’s 
      Self-Determination Program (SDP) thrive. ESS is guided by Person-Centered Thinking (PCT) principles, 
      meaning we focus on the unique strengths, preferences, and goals of every individual we support. 
      Our services are not one-size-fits-all—we tailor our approach to each person’s specific needs, 
      ensuring that supports are meaningful, respectful, and empowering. By collaborating with families 
      and honoring individual voices, we provide staffing and community-based services that promote 
      independence, stability, and opportunities for people to live their best lives, their way.
