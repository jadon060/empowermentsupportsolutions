    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At Empowerment Support Solutions (ESS), we believe that every individual deserves the opportunity to thrive in their own unique way. 
    Our work is rooted in <strong>Person-Centered Thinking (PCT)</strong>, which means we put the voice, choice, and goals of the participant at the center of everything we do. 
    We listen first, then design supports that reflect what is important <em>to</em> and important <em>for</em> the person.</p>

    <p>Whether it’s developing daily living skills, connecting with the community, or building independence, 
    we tailor our services to meet the specific needs of each participant. We recognize that every journey is different, 
    and our role is to walk alongside individuals and families to make sure services are not just provided but are meaningful, respectful, and empowering.</p>

    <p>ESS is committed to flexibility, reliability, and collaboration. 
    We work hand-in-hand with families, Independent Facilitators, and regional center teams to ensure that supports are not only effective but also aligned with the participant’s life vision. 
    Our mission is simple: <strong>supporting people to live their best lives, their way</strong>.</p>
